# Typechain

_Do not edit! Autogenerated during compile_

## Usage

Run compilation to generate
```sh
make compile
```

## Important

Typescript bindings are tracked in git, but frontend client (in subdir `factories`) is ignored by git:
> It is recommended to run compilation locally to work with frontend client
